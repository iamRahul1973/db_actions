# db_actions
a mysal database crud library for php. This library has fetch and delete functions which you can use to fetch details from the databse and to delete data from the db.
We can provide the table, column and condiotions as function params instead of writing the select and delete query everywhere. 
The function will buid the query for you

# todo
currently only fetch and delete functions. Need to include insert and update functions as well.
